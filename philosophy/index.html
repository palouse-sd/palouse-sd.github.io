    <p><strong>Philosophy</strong></p>
<p>Many people claim to produce great software, but few are able to actually
deliver on this.</p>
<p>Every year, software projects become slower and more bloated. Lessons that were
learned years ago were forgotten about. Backlash against the misuse of good
ideas causes the good ideas to be ignored. Managers make bad decisions that
they suffer maintenance of years down the road. Engineers lack investment in
the software they make because they believe, often correctly, that they'll find
a new job before they have to maintain their mistakes.</p>
<p>Instead of whining on the internet, we at <em>PSD</em> believe in learning from the
mistakes of others, and designing software that bucks these trends.</p>
<p><strong>The Modern Web is Good</strong></p>
<p>While web browsers have gotten more bloated and user-hostile, the web itself is
a revolutionary tool for making software:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is driven by open standards.</li>
<li>It has multiple competing implementations.</li>
<li>It allows reaching users without being gate-kept by an app store.</li>
<li>It allows continuous updating without user intervention.</li>
<li>It has solid development tools.</li>
<li>It gives users the freedom to protect their own privacy.</li>
<li>It gives users the ability to extend applications to fit their needs.</li>
<li>It gives developers architectural flexibility.</li>
</ul>
<p>While there are <em>some</em> applications that the web is ill-suited for, it works
for most others. The fact that the web has been misused and abused does not
indict the web itself.</p>
<p><strong>Single Page Applications are Good</strong></p>
<p>When the web was invented, web sites were mostly static. It was not long after
that people demanded dynamic content served from a database, which required
running server-side scripts to render pages. While this model made web
applications possible, it required many layers of ugly hacks, and provided a
terrible user experience when the page was interactive.</p>
<p>Single Page Applications (SPAs) were a concept invented in the late '00s as a
response to increased user demand for highly interactive websites. In the
beginning, the technologies to make this were of poor quality and performance,
and browsers were not optimized for this style of web application. But it was
still an upgrade when applications demanded high amounts of interactivity,
especially when said interactivity does not require making a round-trip to the
server.</p>
<p>Over the following decade, better technologies came out for making SPAs that do
not suck, but business priorities seldom align with this. Rewriting bad
software that at least works is an unnecessary risk. Performance optimizations
take a back seat to feature development and bug fixes. The network effect drove
decisions to optimize for ease of hiring. The web being easy to develop for
resulted in a lot of lower quality developers shipping software. The result of
all of this is that the web is littered with terrible code and people whining
about it.</p>
<p>In the late '10s, some new architectures and frameworks began to take shape
that claimed to solve certain issues with this model. Instead of shipping a
bundle of code to render the page and load content via API call, it would
render the page server side, ship it to the client, and then also load a code
bundle which would hydrate the page so that it would be fully interactive.
Several companies started up to optimize deployment of applications using this
architecture, and it became a new focus for many web frameworks.</p>
<p>At PSD, we believe that this focus is misplaced outside of a few niches. It
solves the problem of search-engine optimization (SEO) in SPAs, and should be
used only in cases where SEO and dynamic content are required at the same time.
Use cases for this would be support forums or e-commerce websites. Other
websites should instead be static websites or full SPAs.</p>
<p>Our SPA framework of choice is Solid.js.</p>
<p><strong>Server-Side JavaScript is Bad</strong></p>
<p>The main issue with this model of server-side rendering + hydration, sometimes
called &quot;Isomorphism&quot;, is that both the client and the server have to be written
in the same language. Because JavaScript is the language of the web frontend
(with very few exceptions), this means that the new model would make JavaScript
the language of the web backend as well.</p>
<p>There are a number of concerns with any programming language when it comes to
backend suitability, but JavaScript exemplifies all of them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Weak type safety (TypeScript makes it better, but not perfect)</li>
<li>Garbage collection, leading to unpredictable resource usage</li>
<li>Interpreted, thus being open to script injection attacks</li>
<li>JIT compilation, thus massively increasing the attack surface</li>
</ul>
<p>Almost any other language is better suited than JavaScript for running on a
server.</p>
<p>At PSD, we believe that Rust is the best language for writing a web backend.
Other languages either have the issues listed or have less mature web
ecosystems.</p>
<p><strong>The Server is More Important than the Client</strong></p>
<p>In the rare event that a transitional application is required, we will either
have to compromise on using Solid.js on the frontend or Rust on the backend.
Both frameworks have a mechanism for running in an isomorphic environment.</p>
<ul>
<li>Solid.js has its SolidStart meta-framework</li>
<li>Rust can compile to wasm to run on the client</li>
</ul>
<p>In general, we avoid wasm due to the fact that it is slower than JavaScript
when it comes to interacting with the browser's DOM. There are multiple
additions to the wasm standard that need to happen, (such as WasmGC) before it
can be adopted generally. Wasm also will result in a larger bundle size than
comparable JavaScript. Thus, we still recommend Solid.js for SPAs.</p>
<p>However, the costs of JavaScript on the server is significantly worse, both in
terms of risks and general performance, than the costs of wasm on the client.
So for an isomorphic application, we recommend using Leptos, a Rust web
framework that can run on both client and server.</p>
<p><strong>The Database is More Important than the Server</strong></p>
<p>If you lose your server, you lose uptime. If you lose your database, you lose
your business.</p>
<p>SQL databases have good tooling and are fairly flexible to schema changes as
the requirements of your application are formalized. They can also scale a
decent amount. We recommend PostgreSQL.</p>
<p>It is always possible that your application grows to the point where a SQL
database no longer performant. This should not happen until you have a large
enough revenue stream that you can hire a team capable of creating a bespoke
combination of databases that will fit your application's specific needs.</p>
<p><strong>Navigating the Software Development Life Cycle</strong></p>
<p>Currently, most companies claim to be following some variant of the Agile
methodology. This methodology originated as a response to traditional
engineering methodologies being too slow and inflexible for software design.
In practice, most companies would &quot;implement agile&quot; at the request of coaches
which end up creating a new set of processes that feel slow and inflexible.</p>
<p>Many startups are able to move faster and disrupt markets because they are
small enough to have not yet developed the kind of processes that slow down
development. This is not an indictment of Agile per-se, but rather that most
companies have incompetent leadership. Larger companies also end up with
internal politics that prevents problems from being solved in the best way.
If the company also has to reach compliance milestones, such as SOC II, then
there will be even more procedure demanded. Agile does not address the issues
in question.</p>
<p>Instead, we need a life cycle paradigm that acknowledges the way that companies
actually exist and the way that software needs to be written. First of all,
there are two distinct phases of a successful company's life:</p>
<ol>
<li>The company is starting up and needs customers to get more revenue</li>
<li>The company has customers and needs to optimize costs for scalability</li>
</ol>
<p>Individual projects within a company can have different stages as well, but an
already profitable company will have the resources and experience to start
optimizing costs sooner. In addition, with many of our tool recommendations,
we try to pick tools that will give a good enough developer experience to not
impede companies that are starting up, while also avoiding the need for risky
rewrites when a company matures. It is also important to give yourself enough
runway to do whatever rewrites need to happen <em>before</em> they start becoming
issues, and we believe that </p>
<p>The place where we believe this shift will happen is in your database. SQL
databases scale reasonably well and give a good foundation for iterative
development. There are many large companies that have been able to scale to
large audiences without the need for abandoning it. Even if it continues to
work well for your business, you will adjust your approach to using it, paying
closer attention to storage engines, indexes, views and more.</p>
<p>If you do chose to change databases, or adopt multiple databases, you will
increase the complexity of your application, and it will be more difficult to
iterate on new features. That's the tradeoff you have to be prepared to make.</p>
